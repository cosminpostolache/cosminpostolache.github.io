              <h2><a style="color:white;" href="Bio.php"> Bio </a></h2>
<p>I was born in 1991 in Bucharest, Romania. My parents bought me a toy keyboard when I was 10. Later on, I received a guitar from my friends' dad, George Marinescu. He showed us the basics and even formed a rock band with us kids, where I got to play guitar and sing. My own father had played a little guitar in his youth, so he showed me songs as well.

</p><p>During this time I also developed a passion for computer programming, although I dreaded spending my whole life at a desk. I had the privilege to study music at college, where I encountered both magical portals and some frustrating dead-ends.

</p><p>After graduating, I tried to make a living playing keyboards and writing music. I also did translations, and later started a career in technical writing.
</p><p>Today I do my best to keep making music and listening.</p>
